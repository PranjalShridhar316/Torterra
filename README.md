🛡️ Torterra – SSH Hardening & Security Toolkit

---
📖 Overview

Torterra is a comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit designed to demonstrate layered defense strategies for securing SSH environments in Linux systems.

It simulates and implements real-world security operations including:

🔐 System hardening (preventive security)
📡 Real-time monitoring (detective security)
🛡️ Intrusion prevention (defensive security)
🚨 Incident response (reactive security)
📊 Continuous auditing (validation & compliance)
⚔️ Threat simulation (resilience testing)

Unlike standalone scripts, Torterra is structured as a multi-phase security ecosystem, mirroring real SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows.

It also includes a terminal-based dashboard, turning raw security scripts into an interactive control center.

🚀 Key Features (Phase-Based Design)


🔹 Phase 1 – SSH Hardening (Preventive Security)
Disable root login (dis_root.sh)
Enforce SSH key-based authentication (key_setup.sh)
Secure SSH configuration baseline

🔹 Phase 2 – Real-Time Monitoring (Detective Security)
Monitor SSH login attempts (monitor_logins.sh)
Detect:
Invalid users
Failed password attempts
Authentication failures
Generate live alerts for suspicious activity

🔹 Phase 3 – Intrusion Prevention (Defensive Security)
Block malicious IP addresses (intrusion_prevention.sh)
Brute-force detection logic
Fail2Ban-style mitigation system

🔹 Phase 4 – Incident Response & Recovery
Log security incidents to:
/var/log/ssh_incidents.log
Structured incident documentation
Supports post-attack forensic analysis

🔹 Phase 5 – Continuous Monitoring & Auditing
SSH configuration auditing (rep_audit.sh)
System health validation
Security compliance checks

🔹 Phase 6 – Threat Simulation & Resilience Testing
Brute-force attack simulation (thrt_simulation.sh)
Port scanning and enumeration tests
SSH hardening validation checks
System resilience verification under attack conditions
📊 Torterra Dashboard (SOC Interface)

Torterra includes a terminal-based security dashboard (dashboard.sh) that acts as a central SOC control panel.
